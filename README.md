# MvcMovie

Reference to this project: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio

What I've done is I've followed the official Microsoft tutorial for MVC and made this app. 

Some of the functionallity is that the user can create, edit, view and delete movies.
