# MvcMovie

Reference to this project: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio

What I've done is I've followed the official Microsoft tutorial for MVC and made this app. 

So, the application works, the user can create, edit, view and delete movies.
